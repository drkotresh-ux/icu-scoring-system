# Privacy Policy for ICU Scoring System

**Last updated:** 25 November 2025

## 1. Introduction

ICU Scoring System (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is a mobile application intended to help qualified healthcare professionals calculate clinical scores such as GCS, qSOFA, SOFA, and APACHE II in the intensive care setting.

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how ICU Scoring System handles information when you use the app.

## 2. Information We Collect

ICU Scoring System is designed to work entirely on your device. It does **not** collect, store, or transmit any of the patient data or clinical values you enter into the app.

- We do not collect names, contact details, identifiers, or any personal information about you or your patients.
- We do not collect or store health information or clinical parameters entered into the calculators.
- We do not use external servers or cloud storage for calculation or data processing.

If, in future versions, we add features that collect or transmit data (for example, online backup, analytics, or error reports), we will update this Privacy Policy and the Google Play Data Safety section accordingly.

## 3. Permissions

ICU Scoring System currently does not request access to sensitive device permissions (such as location, camera, microphone, contacts, or storage) except those required by the Android OS to install and run the app.

If future versions require additional permissions, we will:
- Request them explicitly within the app, and
- Explain their purpose in this Privacy Policy.

## 4. How We Use Information

Since ICU Scoring System does not collect or store personal or sensitive user data, **we do not use such data for analytics, advertising, profiling, or any other purpose**.

Any clinical values you enter are processed locally on your device solely to calculate and display the requested scores.

## 5. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not share any personal or sensitive data with third parties.

- No third-party analytics SDKs
- No advertising SDKs
- No social media plugins

If this changes in a future version, we will update this Privacy Policy and clearly disclose any data sharing.

## 6. Data Security

As ICU Scoring System does not transmit or store user or patient data on our servers, traditional server-side data breaches are not applicable.

However, you remain responsible for:
- Securing your device (e.g., PIN or biometric lock)
- Ensuring that screenshots or exported information are handled according to your local clinical and legal requirements

## 7. Children’s Privacy

ICU Scoring System is for professional healthcare use only and not designed for children or the general public. We do **not knowingly collect data from children of any age**.

## 8. Regulatory and Professional Responsibility

ICU Scoring System is a clinical decision support tool, not a medical diagnosis or treatment provider. It is **not** a substitute for clinical judgment or consultation with appropriate specialists.

You are responsible for:
- Verifying all scores against your unit’s protocols and current clinical guidelines
- Ensuring your use of the app complies with local laws, regulations, and institutional policies

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted here with an updated “Last updated” date. Please review the policy periodically to stay informed.
